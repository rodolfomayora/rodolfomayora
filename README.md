Hi, I'm a Front-End Developer with over 3+ years of experience building and maintaining scalable, high-performance web applications, I specialize in develop exceptional user experiences across multiple devices and web browsers. Proficient in CSS preprocessors (Sass/SCSS) and in JavaScript environments (React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js)

With a solid experience working in agile workflows like SCRUM, delivering clean maintainable code, implementing pixel-perfect designs with responsive user interfaces that align with best practices for Core Web Vitals.

I'm always eager to connect with professionals, explore new opportunities, and contribute to innovative projects in the JavaScript ecosystem. Feel free to reach out.
